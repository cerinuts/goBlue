# goBlue
[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/code.cerinuts.io/libs/goBlue?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/code.cerinuts.io/libs/goBlue)

Development happens over at [code.cerinuts.io](https://code.cerinuts.io)
There is also a [github mirror](https://github.com/cerinuts/goBlue)

The master branch contains the latest stable version. 
However, for our applications i recommend to use the latest stable tag/release (ending with s) for this application

Use [godoc](https://godoc.org/code.cerinuts.io/libs/goBlue), i am way too lazy atm to write a proper readme. 

The reason i wrote goBlue is mainly for learning purposes and convenience, so it is likely not perfect.
