# goBlue
Development happens over at (code.cerinuts.io)[https://code.cerinuts.io]

Please do NOT use the master branch, since it's likely unstable. 
Use the (github mirror)[https://github.com/cerinuts/goBlue] or a stable tag (ending with s)

Use godoc, i am way too lazy atm to write a proper readme.

The reason i wrote goBlue is mainly for learning purposes and convenience, so it is likely not perfect.
