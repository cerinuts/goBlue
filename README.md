# goBlue
Development happens over at [code.cerinuts.io](https://code.cerinuts.io)

Please do NOT use the master branch, since it's likely unstable. 
Use the [github mirror](https://github.com/cerinuts/goBlue) or a stable tag (ending with s)

Use godoc, i am way too lazy atm to write a proper readme.

The reason i wrote goBlue is mainly for learning purposes and convenience, so it is likely not perfect.
